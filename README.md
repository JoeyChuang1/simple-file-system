I have implemented a basic file system prototype that provides core functionalities like opening, closing, writing, reading, seeking, removing files, and retrieving file sizes. This file system utilizes a window-based structure, incorporating elements such as a Superblock, Inodes, Datablocks, and a Free Bitmap for efficient storage management. Additionally, it leverages directory and disk block caches to enhance user experience.

Unfortunately, due to the expiration of my McGill database account, the project is currently inoperable. However, I can provide a detailed PDF outlining the design and implementation for further exploration.
